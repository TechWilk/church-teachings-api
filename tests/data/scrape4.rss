<title>Ephesians : Parents and Children : Graham Shaw : 11Nov18</title>
<itunes:subtitle>Ephesians 6:1-4</itunes:subtitle>
<link>http://www.christchurchchester.com/sermons/2018/181111Ephesians.mp3</link>
<description>
Hello Saints! This term we delve into Paul's letter to some of the early church congregations. Paul gives us his vision of what the church should look like. We'll be looking at how we can apply that to our lives, our church and the communities in which we live.
&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/hr&gt;
Graham looks at the advice Paul gives to Parents and Children about their relationships and quotes from a Tim Keller talk. Children should.....
&lt;ol&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Value their parents (cultural appropriate)&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Don;t assume your parents can't change&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Show them what you've learned from them&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Forgive them&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Leave them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
Parents should

&lt;ol&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Nurture them&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Keep suitable boundaries&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Bring them up in the Lord&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

Hello Saints! This term we delve into Paul's letter to some of the early church congregations. Paul gives us his vision of what the church should look like. We'll be looking at how we can apply that to our lives, our church and the communities in which we live.
&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/hr&gt;
Graham kicks off our new sermon series for the Autumn term

It's about being God centered.

Whatever you do in word or deed. Give thanks to God. 

Whatever you do or say must be able to stand the words written above it 'in the name of Jesus Christ'.

Can you think of someone who has shown godly character to you in the last few weeks. Encourage and thank them.

Graham explains how easy it is to forget all the blessings we have, especially ongoing blessings. We take it for granted and lose grip on reality.
The solution: thankfulness. It is a discipline to pause and say thanks.
A model for giving thanks
Spiritual thank you for jesus, thank you
Physical thank you for me, health, who we are
Emotional thank you I can experience things
Intellectual thank you for intellectual blessings
Material thank you for clothes, money. roof etc
Relational thank you for people you put around me

Ralph explains about the divide between the physical and spiritual world that Valentinism promotes and why he was wrong. We are not "Spirits in a material world" - and all the information we need for our salvation is clearly written for us in the Bible.

Graham explains the early heresy of Ebionitism and its lessons for us as Christians today.
 
1. Importance of believing and knowing that Jesus was the son of God.
2. Being careful of the "back to Judaism" movement. Some good but danger of losing sight of Jesus.
3. Everybody comes to Jesus wearing their own set of glasses. Everyone experiences a paradigm shift.

<description>
The book of Ruth is a story of love shining through in the context of brokenness. In today's broken world, what does it mean for us to live 'loving lives'?
Ralph calls this “Sex, Family and the Future”. Naomi in the face of tragedy acted sacrificially. Ruth did not take the easy way but chose to follow. When all seemed hopeless. Boaz was compassionate on a woman from another land. Stepped up to his responsibility as a redeemer. The baby became forefather of David, and again Jesus. Bethlehem plays it part again in the future. Consequential significance of these acts of love.

Veronica  explains that it's not enough for us to judge. The good news is wonderful beyond comprehension. She used the example of the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/apr/18/judas-window-dorset-church-moreton">"Forgiveness Window"</a> in a church in Dorset. Let's not try to shrink it. Let's tell instead of gods love beyond our understanding. Following Jesus is embarking on the wonderful adventure of eternal life now. It's not possible to identify the uncontaminated wheat. Not yet. God is present in each one of us.

Ralph looks at the teachings of Pelagus, a monk from Britain living in Rome. The initial idea was to live better a life like Jesus. But it ended up being about saving yourself.

This is very much an in vogue idea now as the "self improvement" movement gains ever more force but is this possible?

You’re &lt;b&gt;chosen aliens&lt;/b&gt;, part of a real but &lt;b&gt;unseen kingdom&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;b&gt;Don’t conform&lt;/b&gt; to this world, but &lt;b&gt;live holy lives&lt;/b&gt; within it, loving one another. The world will &lt;b&gt;persecute you&lt;/b&gt;, and falsely accuse you, but &lt;b&gt;confound them&lt;/b&gt; by continuing to bless them. Your gentleness and respect will win some over. Keep the perspective of the coming &lt;b&gt;judgement&lt;/b&gt; and your &lt;b&gt;future glory&lt;/b&gt;, keeping your &lt;b&gt;eyes fixed on Jesus&lt;/b&gt;, who won us our salvation and is our &lt;b&gt;example in everything&lt;/b&gt;.
&lt;div&gt;Typical responses to society

	&lt;li&gt;Condemn. We'll have nothing to do it.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Consume it.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Copy. They do this, so we do the same.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Critique. I like those bits but not those bits.&lt;/li&gt;

<title>Prayers from the Heart : Hannah Prays for a Son: Ralph Kemp: 7Sep14</title>
<itunes:subtitle>Part 1 of 4</itunes:subtitle>
<link>https://christchurchchester2-public.sharepoint.com/sermons/140907Prayer.mp3</link>
<description>&lt;h1&gt;Prayers from the Heart : Hannah Prays for a Son&lt;/h1&gt;Prayers of anguish are not always met with answers. We have a fantastic diverse community in Christchurch. But it can be difficult. If your personal situation is not what you want it to be. We need to understand and accept our own situation and celebrate others. Wherever we are we can look at others and help and rejoice. We can come to church and be real people. Rejoice with those who rejoice. Weep with those weep. Yes it might be difficult to come. But that is what it should be about. Part of this church family.</description>

<title>Journey to Pentecost : Jesus teaches about the Holy Spirit: Rev Graham Shaw: 11May14</title>
<itunes:subtitle>Part 2 of 7</itunes:subtitle>
<link>https://christchurchchester2-public.sharepoint.com/sermons/140511Spirit.mp3</link>
<description>&lt;h1&gt;Journey to Pentecost&lt;/h1&gt;John 20:19-31&lt;p&gt;As the celebration of Pentecost approaches, we look at the changing power of the Holy Spirit, and the restoring effect it can have in our own lives.&lt;p&gt;

John 14:15-26&lt;p&gt;

The cosmic trinity all point to the other parts. The Holy spirit is like Jesus with us. Whatever we see Jesus doing in the gospels is what Jesus does. All Christians have the holy spirit within them.&lt;p&gt;
1. Holy spirit is the teacher of truth.&lt;p&gt;
2. Holy spirit  is the reminder of truth.&lt;p&gt;
3. Holy spirit  is our guide in truth.&lt;p&gt;
4. Holy spirit  is our convictor.&lt;p&gt;</description>

<itunes:subtitle>Part 13 of 16</itunes:subtitle>
<link>https://christchurchchester2-public.sharepoint.com/sermons/140406Mark.mp3</link>
<description>&lt;h1&gt;Mark&lt;/h1&gt;Mark 14:12-26&lt;p&gt;Become immersed in the most beautiful story in the world as we travel through the gospel of Mark.&lt;p&gt;Christianity is the only faith where we have a god who knows what it is like to experience suffering. Jesus provides a model of how we can cope.
1. Remembers who god is.
2. Telling him the situation.
3. I will leave it in your hands.
Jesus does not face death in the way of conventional heros. Jesus is more real.
Later day martyrs seem more confident. Whats the difference? Those Christians had their lives restored while Jesus was facing brokenness. Jesus had a near view of the furnace of wrath. Necessary that he had a full appreciation of his free choice. In order for us to find restoration Jesus had to be ripped apart.</description>

Blessings and bafflement.&lt;p&gt;
The key is God's word. Be real about what it means to be a follower of God. People will be in both states of blessing and bafflement. Church has to hold both in tension. Weep, cry and comfort as we go about our daily week.&lt;p&gt;</description>

At that time Baal was worshipped and was the God of Rain. It’s like taking on Nadal on clay. It was his turf. He spoke truth in a difficult situations.&lt;p&gt;How can we learn? Never think who or what you are is an accident. Ask “where has god put me now so that i can serve him?” Why has God put you in the context you are in?&lt;p&gt;If you are not playing your role God will raise up someone else....&lt;p&gt; If we are blessed in any way we need to ask why we have been blessed and how can we be a blessing to others. God is in the business of raising people up in every situation.</description>
